# Wireless-Soil-Sensor-Network
Wireless sensor network to monitor soil moisture and temperature using Xbee and Arduino and writing to mysql DB



IOT sensor network that I developed to monitor soil mositure and temperature in citrus groves. 

It will monotitor soil mositure at 3 levels as well as soil temp and air temp, relay the info and write it into a mysql DB
The nodes use GPS to fix its position on boot.
